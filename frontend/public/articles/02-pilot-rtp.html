            <h2>What is RTP?</h2>
            <p><strong>RTP (Return to Player)</strong> is a percentage that represents the theoretical amount of money a casino game pays back to players over time. It's one of the most important metrics for understanding a game's long-term payout characteristics.</p>

            <p>For example, if a game has a 97% RTP, it means that for every $100 wagered by players collectively over millions of rounds, $97 is theoretically returned as winnings, while $3 is retained by the house.</p>

            <h3>Key Points About RTP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theoretical:</strong> RTP is a statistical calculation based on the game's mathematical model</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term:</strong> It's calculated over millions of game rounds, not individual sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> It represents returns across all players, not individual outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Inverse of House Edge:</strong> RTP + House Edge = 100%</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="pilot-rtp-explained">
            <h2>Pilot's 97% RTP Explained</h2>
            <p>Pilot by Gamzix boasts an impressive <strong>97% RTP</strong>, placing it among the more player-friendly casino games available. But what does this actually mean for you as a player?</p>

            <h3>The Mathematics</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Pilot RTP Breakdown</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97%</li>
                    <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                    <li><strong>For every $100 wagered:</strong> $97 returned to players (theoretical)</li>
                    <li><strong>Casino retention:</strong> $3 per $100 wagered (theoretical)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>In Pilot, the 97% RTP is built into the game's algorithm that determines when the plane flies away. The multipliers at which rounds end are distributed in a way that, over millions of rounds, 97% of all money wagered is paid back to players.</p>

            <h3>How RTP Works in Crash Games</h3>
            <p>In crash games like Pilot, the RTP is maintained through the distribution of crash points (when the plane flies away). While some rounds crash early at low multipliers, others reach astronomical heights. The weighted average of all these outcomes, combined with player cash-out behavior, results in the stated RTP.</p>

            <p>It's worth noting that the 97% RTP assumes optimal play. If players consistently cash out at suboptimal times or hold too long and lose, their personal RTP may be lower than the theoretical maximum.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="house-edge">
            <h2>Understanding the 3% House Edge</h2>
            <p>The house edge is the mathematical advantage the casino has over players. In Pilot, this is 3% (100% - 97% RTP = 3% house edge).</p>

            <h3>What the House Edge Means</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematical certainty:</strong> Over time, the casino will profit</li>
                <li><strong>Per-bet cost:</strong> On average, you "pay" 3 cents per dollar wagered</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative effect:</strong> The more you play, the more the house edge affects your bankroll</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>House Edge in Context</h3>
            <p>A 3% house edge is relatively low compared to many casino games. Here's how it compares:</p>

            </table>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Important Understanding</h4>
                <p>No betting strategy or pattern can overcome the house edge in the long run. The 3% house edge is built into the game's mathematics and applies regardless of how you bet or when you cash out.</p>

        <section id="rtp-misconceptions">
            <h2>Common RTP Misconceptions</h2>
            <p>There are several widespread misunderstandings about RTP that can lead to poor gambling decisions. Let's address these directly:</p>

            <h3>Misconception 1: "I should get back 97% of my money"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> RTP applies to the aggregate of all players over millions of rounds. In any individual session, you might win big, lose everything, or land somewhere in between. Your personal results will rarely align with the theoretical RTP.</p>

            <h3>Misconception 2: "The game is due for a payout"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Each round in Pilot is completely independent. The game doesn't "remember" previous outcomes or adjust to meet the RTP. This is a classic example of the gambler's fallacy.</p>

            <h3>Misconception 3: "If I play long enough, I'll break even"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The house edge works against you over time. The longer you play, the more the mathematical disadvantage affects your bankroll. RTP doesn't guarantee you'll ever return to your starting amount.</p>

            <h3>Misconception 4: "Higher RTP means I'll win more often"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> RTP doesn't indicate win frequency - it indicates the total amount returned relative to the amount wagered. A high-RTP game might have fewer wins that are larger, or more frequent smaller wins.</p>

            <h3>Misconception 5: "The casino can change the RTP whenever they want"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Licensed and regulated games like Pilot have fixed RTPs that are audited by independent testing agencies. Casinos cannot arbitrarily change these values.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="rtp-in-practice">
            <h2>RTP in Practice: What to Expect</h2>
            <p>Understanding how RTP manifests in real gameplay sessions is crucial for maintaining realistic expectations.</p>

            <h3>Short-Term Variance</h3>
            <p>In any given session, your results can deviate significantly from the 97% RTP. Here are some realistic scenarios:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You deposit $100, play for an hour, and end with $250. Your personal RTP for that session was 250%.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You deposit $100, play for an hour, and lose it all. Your personal RTP for that session was 0%.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario C:</strong> You deposit $100, play for an hour, and end with $85. Your personal RTP for that session was 85%.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All three scenarios are possible and normal, even though the theoretical RTP is 97%.</p>

            <h3>Long-Term Convergence</h3>
            <p>As the number of rounds increases, actual results tend to converge toward the theoretical RTP. However, "long-term" in statistical terms means hundreds of thousands or millions of rounds - far more than any individual player would typically experience.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Statistical Reality</h4>
                <p>For the law of large numbers to bring your results close to the 97% RTP, you would need to play an impractical number of rounds. For most players, short-term variance will dominate their experience.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="variance">
            <h2>Variance and Volatility</h2>
            <p>While RTP tells you how much is returned over time, <strong>variance</strong> (or volatility) describes how that return is distributed. Pilot, like most crash games, has high variance.</p>

            <h3>What High Variance Means</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unpredictable sessions:</strong> Your results can swing wildly from session to session</li>
                <li><strong>Potential for big wins:</strong> The 10,000x maximum multiplier creates opportunities for massive payouts</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of quick losses:</strong> You can also lose your bankroll quickly if planes fly away at low multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional intensity:</strong> High variance games tend to be more exciting but also more stressful</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Variance vs RTP</h3>
            <p>It's important to understand that variance and RTP are independent concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A high-RTP game can be high variance (infrequent large wins)</li>
                <li>A high-RTP game can be low variance (frequent small wins)</li>
                <li>The same applies to low-RTP games</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pilot combines a high RTP (97%) with high variance, meaning you might experience significant swings in your bankroll while the game maintains favorable long-term odds.</p>

                <p>The game's RTP is built into the crash point distribution. However, your personal results depend on when you cash out. If you consistently cash out at very low multipliers, you might have higher win frequency but lower average returns. The opposite is true for high cash-out targets.</p>

                <h3>Why do I seem to lose more than 3%?</h3>
                <p>This is due to short-term variance. The 3% house edge is a long-term average. In any given session, you might lose much more (or win) due to the game's inherent randomness. Your personal results only approach the theoretical RTP over an impractical number of rounds.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there a way to beat the RTP?</h3>
                <p>No. The 97% RTP and 3% house edge are mathematical certainties built into the game. No strategy, pattern recognition, or betting system can overcome this mathematical reality in the long run.</p>

            <h2>Responsible Gambling Reminder</h2>
            <p>Understanding RTP should reinforce one key fact: <strong>gambling is not a way to make money</strong>. The house always has an edge, and over time, most players will lose. Use this knowledge to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set strict loss limits before playing</li>
                <li>View gambling as paid entertainment, not income</li>
                <li>Never try to "win back" losses</li>
                <li>Accept that the math is not in your favor</li>
                <li>Only gamble with money you can afford to lose entirely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, please seek help:</p>
