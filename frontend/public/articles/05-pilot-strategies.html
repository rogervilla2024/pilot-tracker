            <h2>Important: The Truth About Strategies</h2>
            <p><strong>No betting strategy can overcome the house edge.</strong> Pilot has a 97% RTP and 3% house edge. This mathematical reality means that over time, players will lose 3% of all money wagered on average. The strategies discussed below are different approaches to playing, not methods to win consistently. They affect your playing experience (variance, session length, emotional engagement) but not your long-term expected value.</p>

            <h2>The Reality of Gambling Strategies</h2>
            <p>Before exploring different approaches to playing Pilot, it's crucial to understand what strategies can and cannot do:</p>

            <h3>What Strategies CAN Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Affect variance:</strong> Conservative strategies have lower variance; aggressive strategies have higher variance</li>
                <li><strong>Change session dynamics:</strong> Different approaches lead to different win frequencies and payout sizes</li>
                <li><strong>Provide structure:</strong> Following a system can reduce emotional decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Improve discipline:</strong> Pre-defined rules help stick to limits</li>
                <li><strong>Alter the gambling experience:</strong> Some approaches are more thrilling, others more steady</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Strategies CANNOT Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overcome the house edge:</strong> The 3% edge applies to all strategies equally</li>
                <li><strong>Predict outcomes:</strong> Each round is independent and random</li>
                <li><strong>Guarantee profits:</strong> No system can ensure you'll win</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce expected losses:</strong> Over time, you'll lose 3% of what you wager</li>
                <li><strong>Identify "hot" or "cold" streaks:</strong> Such patterns are illusions</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Mathematical Certainty</h4>
                <p>Whether you bet $1 at 1.50x or $100 at 10.00x, whether you use Martingale or flat betting, the expected loss per dollar wagered is always 3 cents. No strategy changes this fundamental math.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="flight-categories">
            <h2>Flight Category Strategies</h2>
            <p>Pilot's unique flight type system provides a framework for thinking about different cash-out targets. Here's how different approaches align with flight categories:</p>

            <h3>Short Flight Strategy (Target: 1.00x - 1.49x)</h3>
            <div class="strategy-box">
                <h4>Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> Highest (~65-85% success per round)</li>
                    <li><strong>Payout Per Win:</strong> Lowest (small profits)</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Low</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Feel:</strong> Steady, many small wins with occasional losses</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>Set auto cash out between 1.10x and 1.50x. You'll win most rounds but with small profits. The challenge: even a 1.10x target means 10% profit per win, but when the plane crashes before reaching that target, you lose 100% of your bet.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>$10 bet with 1.20x target. Win = $12 ($2 profit). Loss = -$10. You need to win 5 times for every 1 loss just to break even at this target.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Domestic Flight Strategy (Target: 1.50x - 2.99x)</h3>
            <div class="strategy-box">
                <h4>Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> Moderate (~35-65% success per round)</li>
                    <li><strong>Payout Per Win:</strong> Moderate</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Moderate</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Feel:</strong> Mix of wins and losses, reasonable payouts</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>Target the 2x range. You'll win less often than short flights but with better payouts. At 2.00x, one win covers one loss, so you need to win more than 50% to be profitable in a session.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>$10 bet with 2.00x target. Win = $20 ($10 profit). Loss = -$10. Win rate needed to break even: 50%.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>International Flight Strategy (Target: 3.00x - 9.99x)</h3>
            <div class="strategy-box">
                <h4>Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> Lower (~10-35% success per round)</li>
                    <li><strong>Payout Per Win:</strong> Higher</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Higher</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Feel:</strong> More losses, but satisfying wins</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>Hold for higher multipliers in the 3x-10x range. You'll lose more rounds, but wins are more substantial. Requires patience and bankroll to weather losing streaks.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>$10 bet with 5.00x target. Win = $50 ($40 profit). Loss = -$10. Win rate needed to break even: 20%.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Intercontinental/Moon Strategy (Target: 10.00x+)</h3>
            <div class="strategy-box">
                <h4>Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Win Rate:</strong> Low (~1-10% success per round)</li>
                    <li><strong>Payout Per Win:</strong> Very high</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Extreme</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Feel:</strong> Many losses punctuated by rare big wins</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>Hold for major multipliers. Most rounds you'll lose, but when you hit, the payout is substantial. Requires significant bankroll and emotional resilience.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>$10 bet with 20.00x target. Win = $200 ($190 profit). Loss = -$10. Win rate needed to break even: 5%.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="conservative">
            <h2>Conservative Approaches</h2>
            <p>Conservative strategies prioritize lower variance and more frequent wins over large payouts.</p>

            <h3>The Low-and-Slow Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Target:</strong> 1.20x - 1.50x</li>
                <li><strong>Bet Size:</strong> 1-2% of bankroll</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Accumulate small, steady profits</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> While you'll win frequently, the occasional loss erases multiple wins. Over time, the house edge still applies.</p>

            <h3>The Safety First Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Target:</strong> 1.10x - 1.20x</li>
                <li><strong>Bet Size:</strong> 2-5% of bankroll</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximize win frequency</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Very high win rate, but profits are tiny. A single loss can wipe out 10+ wins. Not as "safe" as it appears mathematically.</p>

            <h3>Why Conservative Isn't Safer Long-Term</h3>
            <p>Conservative strategies feel safer because you win more often. However, they don't reduce the house edge. They trade large losses for more frequent small losses. Over enough rounds, you'll still lose 3% of your total wagers.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="moderate">
            <h2>Moderate Approaches</h2>
            <p>Moderate strategies seek a balance between win frequency and payout size.</p>

            <h3>The Balanced Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Target:</strong> 2.00x</li>
                <li><strong>Bet Size:</strong> 1-2% of bankroll</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Even risk/reward ratio</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At 2.00x, your profit equals your risk. This creates a clean mental model for understanding your session.</p>

            <h3>The Triple Target</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Target:</strong> 3.00x</li>
                <li><strong>Bet Size:</strong> 0.5-1% of bankroll</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Meaningful wins that outpace losses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Winning at 3x means one win covers two losses, creating potential for session profits despite lower win rate.</p>

            <h3>Hybrid Approach with Dual Bets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet 1:</strong> 50% of round budget at 1.50x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Bet 2:</strong> 50% of round budget at 3.00x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Cover bases - frequent small wins plus occasional bigger wins</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="aggressive">
            <h2>Aggressive Approaches</h2>
            <p>Aggressive strategies accept many losses in pursuit of large wins. High risk, high variance.</p>

            <h3>The Moon Chaser</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Target:</strong> 50x - 100x or higher</li>
                <li><strong>Bet Size:</strong> 0.1-0.5% of bankroll</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Catch rare, large multipliers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> You'll lose most rounds. The emotional toll can be significant. While one big win can recover many losses, there's no guarantee you'll hit before your bankroll depletes.</p>

            <h3>The Ride-or-Die Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Never cash out manually; always wait for plane to fly away</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximum thrill and potential</li>
                <li><strong>Reality:</strong> This guarantees you lose every round. Not recommended.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>High Variance Warning</h4>
                <p>Aggressive strategies can quickly deplete your bankroll. The exciting potential of big wins comes with very real risk of losing everything you've allocated. Only use money you're completely prepared to lose.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="dual-bet">
            <h2>Dual Bet Strategies</h2>
            <p>Pilot allows two bets per round, enabling more complex approaches:</p>

            <h3>The Coverage Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet 1 (70% of round budget):</strong> 1.50x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Bet 2 (30% of round budget):</strong> 5.00x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Secure frequent small wins while maintaining upside potential</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Ladder Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet 1 (50%):</strong> 2.00x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Bet 2 (50%):</strong> 4.00x auto cash out</li>
                <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Tiered cash outs to capture different flight types</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The All-or-Nothing Split</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet 1 (30%):</strong> 1.30x auto cash out (safety net)</li>
                <li><strong>Bet 2 (70%):</strong> No auto, manual cash out (flexibility)</li>
                <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Partial protection with room for judgment calls</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Dual betting doesn't reduce the house edge. It just distributes your risk differently within a single round.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="bankroll">
            <h2>Bankroll Management</h2>
            <p>Regardless of strategy, proper bankroll management is essential for extended play and harm reduction:</p>

            <h3>The Percentage Method</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conservative:</strong> Bet 0.5-1% of bankroll per round</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Bet 1-2% of bankroll per round</li>
                <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> Bet 2-5% of bankroll per round</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Session Limits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Loss Limit:</strong> Stop when you've lost a predetermined amount (e.g., 50% of session budget)</li>
                <li><strong>Win Goal:</strong> Consider stopping after reaching a profit target</li>
                <li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Set maximum playing time regardless of results</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bankroll Reality</h3>
            <p>With a 3% house edge and any bet size, your bankroll will trend toward zero over time. Bankroll management doesn't change this; it only affects how quickly you reach that point and how much variance you experience along the way.</p>

                <h4>Bankroll Survival</h4>
                <p>Smaller bets relative to bankroll = More rounds before bust = More entertainment value per dollar. This is the main benefit of conservative bankroll management.</p>

            <h2>Common Betting Systems (And Why They Don't Work)</h2>
            <p>Various betting systems are often promoted for crash games. Here's why none of them overcome the house edge:</p>

            <h3>Martingale System</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Double your bet after each loss, return to base bet after a win.</p>
            <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> Eventually you'll win and recover all losses plus profit.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Betting limits prevent infinite doubling</li>
                <li>Bankroll depletes during losing streaks</li>
                <li>Risk grows exponentially while reward stays linear</li>
                <li>You're betting more to win less (proportionally)</li>
                <li>The house edge applies to every bet, regardless of size</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anti-Martingale (Paroli)</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Double your bet after each win, return to base after a loss.</p>
            <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> Capitalize on winning streaks.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winning streaks are not more likely after wins</li>
                <li>Each round is independent</li>
                <li>Gives back profits during inevitable losses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fibonacci System</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Follow the Fibonacci sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8...) for bet sizes after losses.</p>
            <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> Recover losses more gradually than Martingale.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Still escalates bets during losses</li>
                <li>Still hits betting limits or bankroll limits</li>
                <li>Still faces the same house edge</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>D'Alembert System</h3>
            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Increase bet by one unit after a loss, decrease by one after a win.</p>
            <p><strong>The Promise:</strong> Balanced approach that smooths out variance.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assumes wins and losses will balance (they might not)</li>
                <li>House edge applies to each individual bet</li>
                <li>No mathematical advantage gained</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Truth About Systems</h4>
                <p>All betting systems are variations of changing bet sizes based on results. None can overcome the fundamental mathematics of a negative expectation game. The house edge is immutable.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Works</h2>
            <p>Given that no strategy beats the house, what approaches actually provide value?</p>

            <h3>Entertainment Maximization</h3>
            <p>Focus on getting the most entertainment for your gambling budget:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smaller bets = more rounds = more playing time</li>
                <li>Choose a variance level that matches your temperament</li>
                <li>View losses as the cost of entertainment, like a movie ticket</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Harm Reduction</h3>
            <p>Focus on minimizing negative consequences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set strict loss limits before playing</li>
                <li>Use only discretionary entertainment funds</li>
                <li>Never chase losses</li>
                <li>Take breaks regularly</li>
                <li>Recognize when gambling stops being fun</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Honest Self-Assessment</h3>
            <p>Ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Am I gambling for entertainment or to make money?</li>
                <li>Can I truly afford to lose this money?</li>
                <li>Am I in control, or is the game controlling me?</li>
                <li>Would I be okay if I lost everything I'm playing with?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the best strategy for Pilot?</h3>
                <p>There is no "best" strategy because no strategy can beat the house edge. The best approach is one that matches your risk tolerance, provides entertainment, and operates within strict limits you set before playing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I change my cash out target based on recent results?</h3>
                <p>No. Each round is independent. Recent results have no influence on future outcomes. Changing your strategy based on past rounds is the gambler's fallacy in action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it better to bet big rarely or small frequently?</h3>
                <p>Mathematically, your expected loss is the same either way (3% of total wagered). Smaller, frequent bets provide more entertainment time but the same expected outcome.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can watching patterns help me win?</h3>
                <p>No. Pilot uses a random number generator. There are no exploitable patterns. Any patterns you think you see are either coincidence or confirmation bias.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why do some people seem to win consistently?</h3>
                <p>They don't - you're likely seeing selective reporting. People share wins more than losses. Over time, all players face the same house edge. Anyone claiming consistent profits is either lying, extremely lucky in the short term, or measuring incorrectly.</p>
