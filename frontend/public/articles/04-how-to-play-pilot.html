            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pilot is a crash-style casino game developed by <strong>Gamzix</strong> that combines vintage aviation aesthetics with thrilling multiplier-based gameplay. If you're new to crash games or specifically to Pilot, this comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.</p>

            <p>The premise is simple: a vintage plane takes off, and as it climbs, a multiplier increases. Your goal is to cash out before the plane flies away. Cash out too late, and you lose. Cash out too early, and you might miss bigger wins. It's this tension between greed and caution that makes Pilot so engaging.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Before You Begin</h4>
                <p>Pilot is a gambling game with real money. The house always has an edge (3%), and you should expect to lose money over time. Only play with money you can afford to lose, and never view gambling as a way to make money.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="game-basics">
            <h2>Game Basics</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the specifics, let's cover the fundamental concepts of Pilot:</p>

            <h3>Key Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Type:</strong> Crash Game / Multiplier Game</li>
                <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Gamzix</li>
                <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97% (Return to Player)</li>
                <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Multiplier:</strong> 10,000x</li>
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Vintage Aviation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Betting Phase:</strong> Players place bets before each round starts</li>
                <li><strong>Flight Phase:</strong> The plane takes off and the multiplier increases</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Out:</strong> Players can cash out at any time during the flight</li>
                <li><strong>Crash:</strong> The plane eventually flies away, ending the round</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Win Condition</h3>
            <p>You win if you cash out before the plane flies away. Your payout is calculated as:</p>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Payout = Bet Amount × Cash Out Multiplier</strong></p>
                <p class="example">Example: $10 bet × 3.50x cash out = $35 payout ($25 profit)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Loss Condition</h3>
            <p>You lose if the plane flies away before you cash out. In this case, you forfeit your entire bet for that round.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-by-step">
            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Playing Pilot</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Access the Game</h3>
                <p>Find Pilot in your online casino's game library. It may be listed under "Crash Games," "Instant Games," or "Gamzix" games. Click to launch the game in your browser.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Understand the Betting Window</h3>
                <p>When you enter the game, you'll see a betting interface. Each round has a betting phase that lasts a few seconds. During this time:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The previous round's result is displayed</li>
                    <li>A countdown or progress bar shows remaining betting time</li>
                    <li>You can enter your bet amount</li>
                    <li>You can set auto cash out targets</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Place Your Bet</h3>
                <p>During the betting window:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter your desired bet amount in the bet field</li>
                    <li>You can use quick bet buttons to select common amounts</li>
                    <li>Click the "Bet" or "Place Bet" button</li>
                    <li>Your bet is confirmed when the button changes state</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Note: You typically can place up to two bets per round, which allows for different strategies within the same round.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Watch the Takeoff</h3>
                <p>Once the betting window closes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The vintage plane begins its takeoff</li>
                    <li>The multiplier starts at 1.00x and begins climbing</li>
                    <li>The climb speed is variable - sometimes fast, sometimes slow</li>
                    <li>Other players' bets and cash outs are visible on screen</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Decide When to Cash Out</h3>
                <p>This is the crucial decision point:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch the multiplier increase</li>
                    <li>Click the "Cash Out" button when you want to secure your winnings</li>
                    <li>The cash out button typically shows your potential payout</li>
                    <li>Your decision should balance risk and reward</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tension comes from not knowing when the plane will fly away. It could be at 1.01x or it could reach 100x or higher.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 6: Round Resolution</h3>
                <p>The round ends when the plane flies away:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If you cashed out:</strong> Your winnings are added to your balance</li>
                    <li><strong>If you didn't cash out:</strong> You lose your bet</li>
                    <li>The final multiplier (crash point) is recorded</li>
                    <li>The game immediately transitions to the next betting phase</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="interface">
            <h2>Understanding the Interface</h2>
            <p>Pilot's interface is designed to be intuitive while providing all necessary information. Here's what you'll typically see:</p>

        </section>

        <section id="betting-options">
            <h2>Betting Options</h2>
            <p>Pilot offers several betting features to accommodate different playing styles:</p>

            <h3>Single Bet</h3>
            <p>The simplest approach - place one bet per round and make one cash out decision.</p>

            <h3>Dual Betting</h3>
            <p>Pilot allows two simultaneous bets per round. This enables strategies such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Split strategy:</strong> Cash out one bet early (safe) and let the other ride (risky)</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage strategy:</strong> Different auto cash out targets for each bet</li>
                <li><strong>All-in approach:</strong> Double your exposure on a single round</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bet Limits</h3>
            <p>Bet limits vary by casino operator, but typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum Bet:</strong> Usually around $0.10 - $1.00</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Bet:</strong> Usually around $100 - $1,000 or more</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Win:</strong> Often capped at a specific amount per round</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Always check the specific limits at your chosen casino.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="auto-features">
            <h2>Auto Bet and Auto Cash Out</h2>
            <p>Pilot includes automation features that can help execute strategies consistently:</p>

            <h3>Auto Cash Out</h3>
            <p>This feature automatically cashes out your bet when the multiplier reaches a target you specify.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set your desired cash out multiplier before the round starts</li>
                <li>If the plane reaches that multiplier, you automatically cash out</li>
                <li>If the plane flies away first, you still lose</li>
                <li>Helps remove emotional decision-making</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Auto Cash Out Example</h4>
                <p>You set auto cash out at 2.00x. The round plays:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiplier reaches 2.00x - you automatically cash out and win</li>
                    <li>If plane flew away at 1.85x - you would lose (didn't reach target)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Auto Bet</h3>
            <p>This feature places bets automatically for consecutive rounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set your bet amount</li>
                <li>Enable auto bet</li>
                <li>Bets are placed automatically each round</li>
                <li>Usually combined with auto cash out</li>
                <li>Can be stopped at any time</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Caution with Auto Features</h4>
                <p>While auto features can help with discipline, they can also lead to rapid losses if not monitored. Always set loss limits and pay attention to your balance when using automation.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="flight-types">
            <h2>Understanding Flight Types</h2>
            <p>Pilot categorizes rounds into flight types based on the final multiplier. While these don't affect gameplay, they help track round history:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Flight:</strong> Low multipliers (typically under 1.50x)</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic Flight:</strong> Moderate multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>International Flight:</strong> Higher multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Intercontinental Flight:</strong> Very high multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Moon Flight:</strong> Exceptional multipliers reaching toward the maximum</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember: Flight types are determined after the round ends. They cannot be predicted, and past flight types do not influence future results.</p>

        <section id="tips-beginners">
            <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>1. Start with Demo Mode</h3>
                <p>Many casinos offer a demo version of Pilot. Use this to understand the mechanics without risking real money.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>2. Set a Budget Before Playing</h3>
                <p>Decide how much you're willing to lose before you start. Once that amount is gone, stop playing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>3. Start with Small Bets</h3>
                <p>While learning, keep your bets small. This allows more rounds to practice and understand the game.</p>

                <h3>4. Don't Chase High Multipliers Initially</h3>
                <p>New players often hold too long hoping for big multipliers. Start with conservative cash out targets to get a feel for the game.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>5. Use Auto Cash Out</h3>
                <p>Setting an auto cash out target removes emotional decision-making and helps maintain consistency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>6. Watch Other Players</h3>
                <p>Observe when other players cash out. While this doesn't affect the game, it can help you understand different approaches.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <h3>7. Take Breaks</h3>
                <p>Crash games are fast-paced. Regular breaks help maintain perspective and prevent fatigue-based mistakes.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Chasing Losses</h3>
                <p>Increasing bets to recover losses is a recipe for bigger losses. Stick to your budget and betting plan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Believing in Patterns</h3>
                <p>Each round is independent. Past results don't influence future outcomes. Don't fall for the gambler's fallacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Always Holding for Big Multipliers</h3>
                <p>High multipliers are rare. Consistently waiting for 10x or higher will result in frequent losses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Ignoring Bankroll Management</h3>
                <p>Betting too much of your bankroll per round leads to quick bust-outs. Experienced players typically bet 1-5% of their bankroll per round.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Playing While Emotional</h3>
                <p>Frustration, excitement, or desperation lead to poor decisions. If you're not in a calm state, don't play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <h3>Not Understanding the Math</h3>
                <p>The 97% RTP means you'll lose 3% of what you wager over time. Understanding this sets realistic expectations.</p>
