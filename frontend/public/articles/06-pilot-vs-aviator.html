            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The crash game genre has exploded in popularity, and aviation-themed entries have become particularly beloved. Two prominent games in this space are <strong>Pilot</strong> by Gamzix and <strong>Aviator</strong> by Spribe. While both feature aircraft and similar core mechanics, they offer distinct experiences.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive comparison will help you understand the differences between these two games, their respective strengths, and what each offers to players. Remember: regardless of which game you choose, both have a house edge that cannot be overcome.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Important Note</h4>
                <p>Neither Pilot nor Aviator offers a mathematical advantage to players. Both have similar RTPs and house edges. This comparison focuses on experience, features, and preferences - not on which is "better" for winning, as neither provides positive expected value.</p>

            <h2>The Providers: Gamzix vs Spribe</h2>

Known for their visually appealing slot games and innovative titles, Gamzix entered the crash game market with Pilot, bringing their signature attention to visual design and unique gameplay features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Founded as a modern game studio focused on online casino games</li>
                <li>Portfolio includes slots, crash games, and innovative formats</li>

                <li>Licensed and regulated, ensuring fair play</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spribe (Developer of Aviator)</h3>
            <p>Spribe is widely credited with popularizing the crash game format through Aviator. The Georgian-based company has become synonymous with the crash game genre and continues to be a major player in this space.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pioneers of the modern crash game format</li>
                <li>Aviator became one of the most popular casino games globally</li>

                <li>Licensed by multiple gaming authorities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="rtp-comparison">
            <h2>RTP and House Edge Comparison</h2>
            <p>When it comes to the mathematical backbone of these games, Pilot and Aviator are remarkably similar:</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h3>Pilot</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97%</li>
                    <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                    <li><strong>Expected Loss:</strong> $3 per $100 wagered</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h3>Aviator</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97%</li>
                    <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                    <li><strong>Expected Loss:</strong> $3 per $100 wagered</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The identical RTP means that from a purely mathematical perspective, neither game offers an advantage over the other. Your expected losses over time are the same regardless of which you play. The choice between them comes down to other factors: aesthetics, features, availability, and personal preference.</p>

            <h3>Variance Comparison</h3>
            <p>Both games are high-variance, with the potential for both rapid losses and significant wins. The exact variance depends on your cash-out strategy rather than the game itself. With similar multiplier distributions to maintain the same RTP, variance profiles are comparable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gameplay">
            <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The core gameplay loop is essentially identical:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Betting Phase:</strong> Place bets before the round starts</li>
                <li><strong>Takeoff:</strong> Aircraft begins ascending, multiplier increases</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Decision:</strong> Click to cash out at current multiplier</li>
                <li><strong>Crash/Fly Away:</strong> Round ends, non-cashed bets lose</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pilot Gameplay Nuances</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vintage plane animation with retro styling</li>
                <li>Flight type classification after each round</li>
                <li>Specific visual and audio feedback based on flight type</li>
                <li>Smooth, nostalgic atmosphere</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aviator Gameplay Nuances</h3>

            </ul>

            <h3>Speed and Pacing</h3>
            <p>Both games offer similar round speeds, with quick betting windows and variable flight durations. The fast-paced nature is a hallmark of crash games in general.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="visual-design">
            <h2>Visual Design and Theme</h2>

            <h3>Pilot's Vintage Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>Pilot embraces a nostalgic, vintage aviation theme:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aircraft Design:</strong> Classic biplane or vintage propeller plane</li>
                <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Warm, sepia-toned with aged textures</li>
                <li><strong>Background:</strong> Reminiscent of early flight era</li>
                <li><strong>Overall Feel:</strong> Charming, nostalgic, like a historical adventure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The vintage theme appeals to players who appreciate retro aesthetics and want a distinctive visual experience that differs from other crash games.</p>

            <h3>Aviator's Modern Design</h3>
            <p>Aviator presents a contemporary, sleek visual approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aircraft Design:</strong> Modern red airplane/jet</li>
                <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Dark backgrounds with vibrant accents</li>
                <li><strong>Background:</strong> Night sky, modern and clean</li>
                <li><strong>Overall Feel:</strong> Dynamic, contemporary, high-energy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aviator's modern design has broad appeal and has become iconic in the crash game genre.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="unique-features">
            <h2>Unique Features</h2>

            <h3>Pilot's Flight Type System</h3>
            <p>Pilot's most distinctive feature is its flight type classification:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Flight:</strong> Quick crashes at low multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic Flight:</strong> Moderate multiplier results</li>
                <li><strong>International Flight:</strong> Higher multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Intercontinental Flight:</strong> Very high multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Moon Flight:</strong> Exceptional multipliers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This categorization adds thematic flavor and helps players track round history, though it has no predictive value.</p>

            <h3>Aviator's Social Features</h3>
            <p>Aviator emphasizes community and social gambling:</p>
            <ul>
