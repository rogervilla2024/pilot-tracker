            <h2>Introduction to Pilot</h2>
            <p>Pilot is a captivating crash-style casino game developed by <strong>Gamzix</strong>, a rising star in the iGaming software industry. Launched as part of Gamzix's expanding portfolio, Pilot brings a unique vintage aviation theme to the popular crash game genre, offering players an immersive experience that combines nostalgic aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional slot machines or table games, Pilot belongs to the rapidly growing category of "crash games" - a relatively new format that has taken the online gambling world by storm. These games are characterized by their simplicity, fast-paced action, and the thrilling tension of deciding when to cash out before a "crash" occurs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="game-overview">
            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>At its core, Pilot is a multiplier-based game where players bet on a vintage aircraft's flight. As the plane ascends, the multiplier increases from 1.00x upward, potentially reaching astronomical heights of up to <strong>10,000x</strong> the original bet. However, there's a catch - the plane can fly away at any moment, ending the round and causing all players who haven't cashed out to lose their bets.</p>

            <h3>Game Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Provider:</strong> Gamzix</li>
                <li><strong>Game Type:</strong> Crash Game</li>
                <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97%</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Multiplier:</strong> 10,000x</li>
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Vintage Aviation</li>
                <li><strong>Special Feature:</strong> Flight Type Categories</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How Pilot Works</h2>
            <p>Understanding how Pilot works is essential for anyone looking to try this exciting crash game. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the gameplay:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Place Your Bet</h3>
            <p>Before each round begins, you have a betting window to place your wager. You can typically place one or two bets simultaneously, allowing for different strategies within the same round.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Watch the Takeoff</h3>
            <p>Once the betting window closes, the vintage plane begins its ascent. A multiplier starts at 1.00x and increases as the plane climbs higher into the sky. The longer the plane flies, the higher the multiplier grows.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Decide When to Cash Out</h3>
            <p>This is where the excitement (and the skill) comes in. You must decide when to click the "Cash Out" button to secure your winnings. Your final payout is your bet amount multiplied by the current multiplier when you cash out.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: The Plane Flies Away</h3>
            <p>At a random point, the plane will fly away, ending the round. If you haven't cashed out by this time, you lose your entire bet. The timing of when the plane flies away is determined by a provably fair algorithm.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example Round</h4>
                <p>You bet $10. The plane takes off and the multiplier climbs: 1.00x... 1.50x... 2.00x... 2.75x... You cash out at 2.75x and receive $27.50 (your $10 bet x 2.75). The plane continues to 4.32x before flying away. You secured a profit of $17.50!</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="key-features">
            <h2>Key Features of Pilot</h2>
            <p>Pilot distinguishes itself from other crash games through several unique features:</p>

            <h3>Vintage Aviation Theme</h3>
            <p>Pilot embraces a nostalgic aesthetic inspired by early aviation pioneers. The visual design features a charming vintage aircraft, retro-style graphics, and an atmosphere reminiscent of the golden age of flight. This thematic approach sets it apart from the more modern or space-themed crash games on the market.</p>

            <h3>Flight Type Categories</h3>
            <p>One of Pilot's most distinctive features is its flight type classification system. Based on the multiplier reached before the plane flies away, each round is categorized into different flight types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Flight:</strong> Low multipliers, quick rounds</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic Flight:</strong> Moderate multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>International Flight:</strong> Higher multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Intercontinental Flight:</strong> Very high multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Moon Flight:</strong> Exceptional multipliers reaching toward the maximum</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>97% RTP</h3>
            <p>With a Return to Player rate of 97%, Pilot offers one of the most favorable RTPs in the crash game category. This means that, theoretically, for every $100 wagered, $97 is returned to players over time.</p>

            <h3>10,000x Maximum Multiplier</h3>
            <p>The potential for a 10,000x multiplier creates exciting possibilities, though it's important to understand that such high multipliers are extremely rare.</p>

            <h3>Auto Cash Out Feature</h3>
            <p>Like most modern crash games, Pilot includes an auto cash out feature that allows you to set a predetermined multiplier at which your bet will automatically be cashed out. This feature is useful for maintaining discipline and executing consistent strategies.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="flight-types">
            <h2>Understanding Flight Types</h2>
            <p>The flight type system in Pilot adds an extra layer of interest to the game by categorizing rounds based on their outcome. While these categories don't affect your gameplay strategy (the outcome is always random), they provide a fun way to track round history and understand the distribution of results.</p>

            <p>It's crucial to understand that the flight type of a round is determined <strong>after</strong> the round concludes. There is no way to predict what type of flight the next round will be. Each round is independent, and past results do not influence future outcomes - this is a fundamental principle known as statistical independence.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Important: Gambler's Fallacy Warning</h4>
                <p>Believing that a "Moon Flight" is "due" because there haven't been any recently is a classic example of the gambler's fallacy. Each round in Pilot is completely independent, and the probability of any given outcome remains constant regardless of previous results.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="rtp-house-edge">
            <h2>RTP and House Edge</h2>
            <p>Pilot's 97% RTP translates to a 3% house edge, which means the casino retains 3% of all wagers over time. While this is favorable compared to many casino games, it's essential to understand what this means for players:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>RTP is calculated over millions of rounds, not individual sessions</li>
                <li>Short-term results can vary significantly from the theoretical RTP</li>
                <li>The house edge ensures the casino maintains a mathematical advantage</li>
                <li>No strategy can overcome the house edge in the long run</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding these mathematical realities is crucial for maintaining healthy gambling habits and realistic expectations.</p>
