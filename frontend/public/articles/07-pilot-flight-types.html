            <h2>Introduction to Flight Types</h2>
            <p>One of Pilot's most distinctive features is its <strong>flight type classification system</strong>. Unlike other crash games that simply display the crash multiplier, Pilot categorizes each round into a thematic flight type based on how far the vintage plane travels before flying away.</p>

            <p>This system adds a layer of engagement and helps players visualize the round history in memorable terms. Instead of remembering "that round crashed at 1.35x," you might recall "there were three Short flights in a row."</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Critical Understanding</h4>
                <p>Flight types are determined <strong>after</strong> each round concludes. They have <strong>no predictive value</strong>. Each round is independent, and the flight type of previous rounds does not influence future outcomes in any way.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How Flight Types Work</h3>
            <p>When a round ends, the final multiplier (the point at which the plane flew away) determines the flight type. Higher multipliers correspond to "longer" journeys in the thematic framework. The categorization is purely descriptive - it describes what happened, not what will happen.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>

                        <th>Frequency</th>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Theme</th>
                        <td>The plane barely gets airborne before departing</td>
                    </tr>

                        <th>Player Impact</th>

                </table>

                <h4>Understanding Short Flights</h4>
                <p>Short flights represent the most frequent outcome in Pilot. The plane takes off but quickly flies away, leaving little time for players to react. These rounds are essential to the game's mathematics - they create the losses that fund the occasional high multiplier rounds.</p>

                <h4>Why Short Flights Are Common</h4>
                <p>For Pilot to maintain its 97% RTP while offering multipliers up to 10,000x, the majority of rounds must end at low values. If every round reached high multipliers, the game would be unsustainable. Short flights are the mathematical counterbalance to rare Moon flights.</p>

                <h4>Short Flight Scenarios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1.01x crash:</strong> Nearly instant - almost no one can manually cash out in time</li>
                    <li><strong>1.20x crash:</strong> Very quick - only those with low auto cash outs profit</li>
                    <li><strong>1.45x crash:</strong> Brief but allows some reaction time</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="domestic-flight">

                        <th>Frequency</th>

                        <th>Theme</th>

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h4>Understanding Domestic Flights</h4>
                <p>Domestic flights represent a middle ground - not as disappointing as Short flights, but not particularly remarkable either. These rounds give players reasonable time to decide whether to cash out and offer modest but achievable multipliers.</p>

                <h4>Strategic Considerations</h4>
                <p>Many conservative strategies target the Domestic flight range (particularly 1.50x - 2.00x). At these multipliers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Win frequency is still relatively high</li>
                    <li>Payouts are meaningful (50-100%+ profit)</li>
                    <li>The risk/reward balance is moderate</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Domestic Flight Scenarios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1.60x crash:</strong> Quick but not instant - 60% profit for early cashers</li>
                    <li><strong>2.00x crash:</strong> Doubling point - classic target for many players</li>
                    <li><strong>2.80x crash:</strong> Nearly tripling - solid outcome for patient players</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="international-flight">
            <h2>International Flight</h2>

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h4>Understanding International Flights</h4>
                <p>International flights are satisfying rounds that reward patience. When a round enters this territory, players who held past the 2x mark are rewarded with meaningful multipliers. However, the temptation to cash out grows as the multiplier climbs.</p>

                <h4>The Tension Zone</h4>
                <p>This range represents peak psychological tension for many players:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At 3x, you've tripled your bet - should you secure it?</li>
                    <li>At 5x, you're doing great - but could it go higher?</li>
                    <li>At 8x, amazing gains - but one more second could mean 10x...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This tension is the core of crash game psychology.</p>

                <h4>International Flight Scenarios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3.50x crash:</strong> Solid win - 250% profit for holders</li>
                    <li><strong>5.00x crash:</strong> Excellent outcome - 5x multiplier is psychologically significant</li>
                    <li><strong>9.50x crash:</strong> Near the threshold to Intercontinental - impressive win</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="intercontinental-flight">

                <h4>Understanding Intercontinental Flights</h4>
                <p>Intercontinental flights are notable events. When the multiplier breaks into double digits, the round becomes memorable. These flights can turn small bets into significant wins - a $10 bet cashed at 50x yields $500.</p>

                <h4>The Rarity Factor</h4>
                <p>Reaching 10x or higher requires both:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The round itself to reach that multiplier (random)</li>
                    <li>The player to hold that long (discipline/risk tolerance)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many players cash out well before 10x, so even when these rounds occur, few fully capitalize on them.</p>

                <h4>Intercontinental Flight Scenarios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>15.00x crash:</strong> 15x your bet - very satisfying win</li>
                    <li><strong>35.00x crash:</strong> Major outcome - turns $10 into $350</li>
                    <li><strong>80.00x crash:</strong> Approaching Moon territory - exceptional result</li>

                <p>Moon flights are the legendary rounds that players dream about. When a round exceeds 100x, it enters exceptional territory. The maximum multiplier of 10,000x represents the ultimate Moon flight - turning $10 into $100,000.</p>

                <p>While exciting to imagine, it's important to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extremely rare:</strong> 100x+ happens roughly once per 100 rounds on average</li>
                    <li><strong>1000x+ is rarer still:</strong> Perhaps once per 1,000 rounds</li>
                    <li><strong>10,000x is exceptional:</strong> You might never see one in your playing career</li>
                    <li><strong>Most players cash out earlier:</strong> Even during Moon flights, most have already cashed</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Moon Flight Scenarios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>150x crash:</strong> Rare and exciting - $10 becomes $1,500</li>
                    <li><strong>500x crash:</strong> Very rare - major win for any player still in</li>
                    <li><strong>2,500x crash:</strong> Exceptional - $10 becomes $25,000</li>
                    <li><strong>10,000x (max):</strong> Legendary - maximum possible win</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4>Moon Flight Reality Check</h4>
                    <p>Don't structure your gambling around waiting for Moon flights. They're too rare to rely on, and the losses accumulated while waiting will typically exceed any eventual Moon flight win. The house edge applies equally to all strategies.</p>

            <h3>Visualizing the Distribution</h3>
            <p>If you played 100 rounds, you might approximately expect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>~35-40 Short flights</li>
                <li>~25-30 Domestic flights</li>
                <li>~15-20 International flights</li>
                <li>~5-10 Intercontinental flights</li>
                <li>~0-2 Moon flights (possibly none)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This distribution is what maintains the 97% RTP: many small losses (Short/Domestic crashes for players waiting for more) offset by occasional larger wins.</p>

            <h2>Why Flight Types Cannot Be Predicted</h2>
            <p>It's crucial to understand why observing flight type patterns cannot help you win:</p>

            <h3>Random Number Generation</h3>
            <p>Each round's crash point is determined by a Random Number Generator (RNG) that produces outcomes with no pattern or memory. The algorithm doesn't know or care about previous results.</p>

            <h3>Statistical Independence</h3>
            <p>Each round is <strong>statistically independent</strong>. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The probability of any outcome is the same every round</li>
                <li>Previous results do not influence future results</li>
                <li>Streaks of Short flights don't make Moon flights more likely</li>
                <li>A Moon flight doesn't make subsequent Short flights more likely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Gambler's Fallacy</h3>
            <p>Believing that a Moon flight is "due" after many Short flights is the <strong>gambler's fallacy</strong>. Common misconceptions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"It's been 50 rounds since a Moon flight, one must be coming"</strong> - False. The probability remains constant.</li>
                <li><strong>"Three Short flights in a row means the next will be longer"</strong> - False. No relationship exists.</li>
                <li><strong>"The game balances out over time, so good flights are coming"</strong> - Partially true statistically, but not in the way that helps you. Regression to mean occurs through new average results, not compensating outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Mathematical Truth</h4>
                <p>If Short flights have ~35% probability, that probability remains ~35% regardless of whether the last 10 rounds were Short flights or Moon flights. The dice don't remember previous rolls.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Flight History</h2>
            <p>While tracking flight history cannot predict future results, it can still serve some purposes:</p>

            <h3>Legitimate Uses of History Tracking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Adds engagement and interest to the game</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding the game:</strong> Helps visualize typical distributions</li>
                <li><strong>Personal records:</strong> Track your own wins and losses</li>
                <li><strong>Educational:</strong> Learn about probability through observation</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic expectations:</strong> See how often different flight types actually occur</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Illegitimate Uses (Don't Do This)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Using patterns to predict next round's outcome</li>
                <li>Increasing bets because a certain flight type is "due"</li>
                <li>Developing "systems" based on observed sequences</li>
                <li>Believing you've found exploitable patterns</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are flight types the same across all casinos?</h3>
                <p>The core categorization system is part of Pilot's design by Gamzix, so it should be consistent. However, specific multiplier thresholds for each category may have minor variations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do flight types affect payouts?</h3>
                <p>No. Your payout is based solely on the multiplier at which you cash out, not the flight type classification. Flight types are purely descriptive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I filter or search for specific flight types in history?</h3>
                <p>This depends on the interface. Some versions of Pilot may allow filtering round history by flight type, which can be interesting for observation but not for prediction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I've seen 10 Short flights in a row. Is a Moon flight coming?</h3>
                <p>No. Each round is independent. The probability of a Moon flight (roughly 1%) is the same whether the previous round was a Short flight or another Moon flight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I bet more when I think a Moon flight is coming?</h3>
                <p>No. You cannot predict when Moon flights will occur. Betting more based on expected outcomes that you cannot predict is a losing strategy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the longest streak of Short flights possible?</h3>
                <p>Theoretically, there's no limit. With ~35% probability per round, long streaks are unlikely but statistically possible. Don't let streaks influence your betting - they're normal variance.</p>
